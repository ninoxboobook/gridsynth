        <h2>About gridsynth</h2>
        <p>Gridsynth is an art project by Rihana Ries.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the generative music of Brian Eno, <b>gridsynth</b> takes energy grid data from the <a href="https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/data-dashboard-nem">National Energy Market</a> and turns it into a replayable song that also tells a story about energy demand and supply. That is, by listening to a gridsynth-generated song, we can also understand a little bit about what was going on with the electricity grid at a particular point in time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each note you hear played by gridsynth corresponds to a five minute interval.</li>
            <li>The tempo (speed) of the song is determined by energy demand in megawatts.</li>
            <li>Each fuel source (e.g. coal, wind, solar) is assigned its own unique instrument.
            <ul>
                <li>Coal generation is represented by a sine-wave oscillator with a long attack, creating a note that sounds a little like a "whomp".</li>
                <li>Wind generation is represented by a sine-wave oscillator passed through a ping-pong delay, creating a note that has a cascading echo which introduces some interesting syncopation.</li>
                <li>Gas generation is represented by a frequency-modulated synth that is passed through a chorus, creating a note that is quite sharp and tinny.</li>
                <li>Hydro generation is represented by a sampler that plays a piano sample that is also passed through a chorus.</li>
                <li>Solar generation is represented by a sampler that plays a cello sample.</li>
                <li>Battery generation is represented by a sampler that plays a French horn sample.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
            <p>Gridsynth uses Tone.js and p5.js.</p>
