## The energy grid ... as sound.

This is a proof-of-concept using Tone.js to generate a soundscape based on 24 hours of data from the Victorian energy grid.

The soundscape is currently generated from a static data source and hard-coded melodies.

Data comes from the [National Energy Market](https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem).

This current version expresses scheduled demand, generation by fuel type, and fuel mix.
